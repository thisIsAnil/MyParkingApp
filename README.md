# MyParkingApp
Android App Soultion for validating and allocating parking slot problem statement in COEP'S MINDSPARK'16 HACKATHON.
The application uses camera installed on device running MyParking App Server and automatically clicks images whenever a person is detected in frame of camera  and validates the person using <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/services/cognitive-services/face/" >Microsoft's Cognitive Services Face API</a>.<br> Once Validated the person is allocated an empty parking slot number based on shortest distance algorithm. The solution assumes predefined static map of parking area i.e a rectangular area which can be resize for different width and height from settings(Note: All previous data will be lost if setting is changed).
